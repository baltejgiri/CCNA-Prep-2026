## CML Lab Grades

### Lab-10 — Securing Network Devices (Ch 10)

**Date:** 2026-04-13 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **CML Lab ID:** `e4304fec-0bb5-4eee-9e95-9814aecf5cdd`  
**Final Score: 73 / 82 (89%)** ⚠️ Good

**Exam Topics:** 1.1.c (NGFW/IPS), 4.8 (SSH), 5.3 (local passwords)

| Task | Points | Score | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task 1 | 15 | 15/15 | Enable secret + `service password-encryption` + console/VTY passwords on R1 |
| Task 2 | 20 | 20/20 | Local user `admin` privilege 15 on R1 and R2; VTY uses `login local` |
| Task 3 | 20 | 20/20 | SSH v2, RSA 2048, timeout 60, retries 3, VTY transport ssh-only on R1 |
| Task 4 | 20 | 18/20 | SSH v2 configured on R2; minor gap in timeout/retries verification |
| Task 5 | 15 | 0/15 | SSH connectivity test — not completed (ASA1 enable password loop blocked ASA access) |
| Task 6 | 10 | 0/8 | ASA NGFW exploration — revised to knowledge questions only; ASA CLI inaccessible |
| **Total** | **100** | **73/82** | |

**Notes:**
- Task 5 and Task 6 were impacted by the ASA1 enable password configuration issue (no enable password set in base config; device stuck at password prompt)
- Task 6 was scoped to CCNA knowledge questions only — ASA CLI commands (ACL/access-group) are not testable on CCNA 200-301 exam
- Lab score out of 82 reflects adjusted rubric excluding unreachable ASA CLI tasks

### Lab-11 — Implementing Switch Port Security (Ch 11)

**Date:** 2026-04-14 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **CML Lab ID:** `5951f588-5611-4dc2-8d9d-1663eca74546`  
**Final Score: 99 / 100 (99%)** ✅ Excellent — Exam Ready

**Exam Topic:** 5.7 — Configure and verify Layer 2 security features (port security)

| Task | Points | Score | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task 1 | 5 | 5/5 | Verified all active ports in access mode; `switchport mode access` on Gi0/0–Gi0/3 |
| Task 2 | 15 | 15/15 | Sticky MAC + Shutdown on Gi0/1; `5254.0096.a991 SecureSticky` learned, 0 violations |
| Task 3 | 15 | 14/15 | Static MAC `0000.1111.2222` + Restrict on Gi0/2; 38 violations logged; minor config-order note |
| Task 4 | 15 | 15/15 | Static MAC `0000.3333.4444` + Protect on Gi0/3; 0 violations (correct — protect mode) |
| Task 5 | 20 | 20/20 | Shutdown on Gi0/0; ROGUE triggered err-disabled; `%PM-4-ERR_DISABLE` syslog confirmed |
| Task 6 | 15 | 15/15 | `errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation` + 30s timer; 6+ recovery cycles observed |
| Task 7 | 5 | 5/5 | N/A — CML IOSvL2 has only 4 interfaces, all in use. No unused ports to shut down. Concept understood. |
| Task 8 | 10 | 10/10 | All `show port-security`, `show errdisable recovery`, `show mac address-table` commands run |
| **Total** | **100** | **99/100** | |

**Key grading evidence from CML console log:**
```
Gi0/0: err-disabled  |  Violations: 4  |  Mode: Shutdown
Gi0/1: Secure-up     |  Violations: 0  |  Mode: Shutdown  |  Sticky: 5254.0096.a991
Gi0/2: Secure-up     |  Violations: 38 |  Mode: Restrict  |  Static: 0000.1111.2222
Gi0/3: Secure-up     |  Violations: 0  |  Mode: Protect   |  Static: 0000.3333.4444
errdisable recovery: psecure-violation Enabled | Interval: 30 seconds
```

**Task 3 note (−1 pt):** `show port-security address` showed two entries for Gi0/2 (`0000.1111.2222 SecureConfigured` + `5254.00c0.a948 SecureDynamic`). With `maximum 1`, this suggests port-security was enabled before the static MAC was applied, allowing a brief dynamic learn. Correct configuration order: `maximum` → `mac-address` → `violation` → `switchport port-security` (enable last).

| Ch 10 | Q6 | Firewall/IPS concepts | Cleared ✅ — 100% post-read |
| Ch 11 | Q1 | Default violation mode (`shutdown` is default) | Cleared ✅ — demonstrated in Lab-11 Task 5 |
| Ch 11 | Q2 | Protect vs Restrict — protect has no counter increment or syslog | Cleared ✅ — demonstrated in Lab-11 Tasks 3 & 4 |

## Priority Focus Areas

Based on DIKTA results and lab performance:

| Topic | Priority | Why |
|---|---|---|
| NAT (Ch 14) | 🔴 High | Known weak area |
| QoS (Ch 15) | 🔴 High | Known weak area |
| SDN/Automation (Ch 21–24) | 🔴 High | High exam weight, conceptual |
| Wireless Security (Ch 3) | 🟡 Medium | Overlaps with Security track |
| FHRP (Ch 16) | 🟡 Medium | Protocol details easy to confuse |
| NGFW vs IPS (Ch 10) | 🟡 Medium | Lab-10 Task 6 — ASA inaccessible; FTD vs ASA distinction needs reinforcement |
| ACLs (Ch 6–8) | 🟢 Low | CML lab 100%, reviewed |
| Security Fundamentals (Ch 9) | 🟢 Low | 89% DIKTA, weak Q reviewed |
| Securing Network Devices (Ch 10) | 🟢 Low | 100% post-read DIKTA, Lab-10 89% |
| Switch Port Security (Ch 11) | 🟢 Low | Lab-11 99%, Q1/Q2 weak areas cleared via lab |
